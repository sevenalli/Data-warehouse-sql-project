## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project adheres to the Medallion Architecture, comprising Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Involves data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema suitable for reporting and analytics.
